To create a new project using this command, open a terminal window and 
navigate to the folder where you want the project created and issue the 
following command:

  cva_create folder app_id app_name [platform list]

So, to create a sample Android project called Hello2 in a folder called 
hello_2 you would use the following command:

  cva_create hello_2 com.johnwargo.hello2 Hello2 android

To create the same project, but include an iOS project as well, you would 
use the following command:

  cva_create hello_2 com.johnwargo.hello2 Hello2 android ios
